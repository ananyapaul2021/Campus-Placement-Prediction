# Campus-Placement-Prediction
Summer Training Project under our B.Tech curriculum authorized by WebTek Labs

Our model aims to predict the employability chances for a student. The model is trained on a very small dataset, works on the logistic regression algorithm, and establishes an accuracy score of 82% when tested with the desired input. The dataset along with the code is uploaded in GitHub; We have provided a documentation report for our project as well

I would like to thank my collaborators - Anupam Chakraborty, Anurag Ganguly and Aniket Das for their able support
